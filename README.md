# Coffee_Machine
 This code project provides a basic implementation of a coffee machine program, demonstrating concepts such as dictionaries, functions, input handling, and resource management. It allows users to select from various coffee options such as espresso, latte, or cappuccino.

This code project represents a simple coffee machine program. It allows users to select from various coffee options such as espresso, latte, or cappuccino, and handles the process of checking resource availability, processing coins for payment, and serving the selected coffee. The available resources include water, milk, and coffee, with their respective quantities tracked. The program also maintains a global variable to keep track of the total money earned.

The code utilizes a menu dictionary to store information about each coffee option, including its ingredients and cost. The resources dictionary holds the current quantities of available resources. The program uses functions to update resources based on the selected coffee, process coin inputs, and check the availability of resources.

The program features a coffee logo from the art module, which is displayed at the beginning of execution. Users can interact with the coffee machine by entering their choice of coffee, checking a report of available resources and total money, or turning off the machine.

Overall, this code project provides a basic implementation of a coffee machine program, demonstrating concepts such as dictionaries, functions, input handling, and resource management.
